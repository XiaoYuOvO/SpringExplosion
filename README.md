## What Does This Mod Do?
Minecraft only offers a simple firework rocket, which is insufficient for creating festive-themed firework PVP maps.  
This mod adds over a dozen unique fireworks with diverse functionalities to expand the variety of fireworks in Minecraft and facilitate firework-based PVP gameplay.

## Prerequisites
This mod requires **Geckolib 4.2.2** or higher.  
*(This mod already includes **CardinalComponent-Base** and **CardinalComponent-Item v5.2.2**.)*

## Firework Mechanics Detail
### Damage Mechanics of Fireworks
Fireworks and their explosions in this mod respect team settings by default:
- Fireworks thrown by players **without a team** will damage and affect all other entities.
- Fireworks thrown by players **with a team** will **not** damage or affect teammates.

### Offhand fusing and firing
When you used a firework that needs fusing(like spark sword) or can continuously firing(like the firework machine gun)\
you can use it again or throw it out to make it drop as an entity and it will keep fusing or firing on the ground.

### Glowing effects
The glowing effect of Firecrackers and Firework Mine can only be seen by its owner.
The glowing effect caused by Glowing Bomb and the Sticky Bomb's is visible for everyone

## Firework Demonstrations
Detailed descriptions of each firework can be viewed in-game through the Creative Mode inventory.  
We also provide in-game screenshots for previewâ€”check them out on the **Gallery page**(In modrinth page)!
